                    All I can say about this Malaysian Fried Chicken is that it’s lip-smacking, finger-licking good! It is served in all ‘mamak’ stalls in Malaysia, which are open until the wee hours of the morning – perfect for a late supper after a big night out at a club. It’s great as an appetiser, but it’s most often served with coconut rice, or as part of nasi lemak.

                <p>
                    Mongolian Beef is a recipe that I’ve been cooking for clients for many years for a number of reasons. One, people love anything that tastes like Chinese takeout. Two, the sweet flavor of the dark brown sugar mixed with the salty soy sauce and the strong ginger and garlic is incredibly addicting and three you get to enjoy it over a mountain of steamed rice.

                <p>
                    Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation.
